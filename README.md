# BroncoCast iOS App

This is a companion app to the BronoCast service. See [the website](https://www.broncocast.org) for more information.

BroncoCast was developed to support a high school robotics team - FRC 1987, The Broncobots
[www.teambroncobots.com](http://www.teambroncobots.com). We needed a way to easily send out
email and text message blasts to our team's students, mentors, and parents.
